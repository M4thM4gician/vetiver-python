# Vetiver

The goal of vetiver is to give data scientists and other model-builders the tools to deploy their model to a remote endpoint.

Key features include:

- **Simple:** designed to fit into a data scientist's natural workflow
- **Robust:** ability to check input data types to minimize type failures in a model
- **Advanced support:** easily deploy multiple endpoints to handle pre- and post- processing
- Based on [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi), using [OpenAPI](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification)
